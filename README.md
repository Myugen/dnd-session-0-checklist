# dnd-session-0-checklist
This checklist is a compilation of topics, that could be relevant to discuss before starting a new D&D game. Many of the topics apply to other RPGs as well. The list is compiled primarily for personal use.

The checklist is heavily inspired by [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/601awb/session0_topic_checklist_and_guide/) on reddit.

## Out of game expectations
- **Alcohol**\
Can players drink at the table? Do you care if your players get drunk? What happens when someone gets drunk? What happens when a player arrives to the session & they are already drunk? Should there be consequences, if so, what are the consequences?

- **Narcotics**\
Same considerations as Alcohol, but perhaps you have different rules & consequences than with Alcohol. Though perhaps similar, I have found it best to discuss this seperately from Alcohol.

- **Cellphones & Digital Devices**\
Do you allow them at the table? Do they need to be left in the basket at the door? If you do allow them, what happens when a player gets a call they must take? Do you allow headphone use at the table? Should there be consequences for when this becomes a problem, if so, what are the consequences?

- **Player Attention**\
What happens if a player is constantly distracted? What happens if they are constantly delaying the game because they are NOT paying attention? Should there be consequences for when this becomes a problem, if so, what are the consequences?

- **Disruptive topics**\
Are real-life topics like religion, politics, porn, or sex ok at your table? What about sports? Are there other topics that are disruptive? Maybe its ok to talk about these kind of things before the session starts, but not during the session? Many of these topics can lead to heated discussions that can be disruptive to a game session & upsetting to other players. While this more applies to online D&D games, it can still be an issue for offline D&D games as well. Should players arrive an hour early so that they can do a bit of socializing before the session?

- **Unannounced dice rolls**\
What happens when a player make a dice-rolls without saying anything, only then to say, "I just rolled a nat-20 on my perception check." or are only dice-rolls are allowed to me made when prompted? How are dice rolls handled? Can players can make their rolls when they think they need to?

- **Dice rolls against one another**\
Are dice rolls allowed to be used to settle in-character arguments? Can the Bard PC roll to persuade the Fighter PC that his course of action is right? Or is this kind of thing not allowed at all? or Is it something thats allowed sparingly, but only under the DMs guidance, or only when prompted by the DM? Perhaps everyone at the table has to agree to allow such rolls first?

- **Player Vs Player**\
Is tension between characters allowed? What about argument between characters? Is combat between two or more PCs allowed? What happens when character tension finally breaks out into violence between those two characters? Is allowed only if the DM approves? Does the whole table have to approve the PvP? What is your stance on PvP as a DM?

- **PC Secrets**\
Are players allowed to keep in-game secrets from other players? Are characters allowed to keep in-game secrets from other characters? If so, who decides what secrets are allowed? Is this sort of thing left up to the players? Is it only the privilege of the DM?

- **Player Expectations, Types, Goals & Diversity**\
What happens when one players expectations ruins the fun of another player? Does every player at your table need to be there for the same reasons as ever other player? Is it ok for that Tim is only here for the sweet loots & EXP, while Mary-Sue is here to role-play her snow-flake? Ann is just here to 'kill shit', while Steve has brought a completely min/maxed PC to the table, & poor Billy, he is here just to hang out with is friends & have pizza. DMs you may want to discuss with each player at the table, why they are here & what they hope to get out of the game & how you as a DM can meet those hopes & expections. If for some reason you can not, discuss that with the player & offer what you can do instead. After you have, you may want to reinforce that you are all there to have fun, but have different ideas of what fun is.

- **Player Discomfort**\
Occasionally things may happen in-game that makes a player unconfortable. There maybe times where everyone agreed about a particular topic in session-0, but when it actually surfaces in-game, the player may find out that they in fact are NOT comfortable with it. How are such things handled? Is there a time-out system? Does the DM call a break and this become a table discussion? Is the player allowed to step out on the scene & come back after it has passed? Does the DM use a RetCon to the story?

- **Player Agency**\
As a DM, how do you feel about player agency? What is your stance on it? Is it a possibility that the Warlock actually becomes possessed by his Patron? What about when a PC becomes a Werewolf? When does that PC become a DM controlled character? What are the ways PCs can use to un-petrify their fellow PCs from the effects of a Basilisk?, a Medusa? Historically, D&D has not cared much about player agency, what the DM said, is what happened but it has gotten signifcantly better about it as the editions have passed, save-or-die effects kind-of linger but are gone for the most part. Players (veteran or not) coming to play D&D though, may actually welcome & want this kind of thing, while other players may not. DMs you may want to discuss it with your table.

- **Game Balance & Fairness**\
As a DM, what are your feelings about the balance of the game you are playing? How will you as a DM handle encounter balance? Will you constantly be throwing only Deadly encounters at the PCs? Perhaps you feel that in this kind of sandbox campaign, players can stumble into the Ancient Red Dragons lair at level 1? OR perhaps you feel that the game is broken, or the balance it presents is a farce, so you will employ other means of being fair to your players?

- **Rules Debates**\
As a DM, how do you handle rules debates? Does the game pause to look up rules? Does the DM make a quick ruling to keep game flow & then the rule is looked up later? Perhaps as a DM you use some combination of both?

- **Spotlight Sharing**\
Are players allowed to have spot-light focus? or will the spot-light only be focused on the party as a whole? Are players or characters allowed to steal another PCs spotlight? What happens if a player or his/her character tramples over another characters scene/spotlight? This kind of thing can ruin another players fun, but it is also the kind of that that the player won't immediately voice their discomfort about. DMs you may want to try to be watchful of this.

- **Meta-knowledge**\
Do you allow it? Is it ok for players to know that swinging their weapon as a ghost will not harm it? Are characters allowed to know that trolls don't regenerate health when harmed with acid or fire? What about when it comes to multiple rolls? Just because the Wizard player knows the Rogue rolled low for his check for traps, would it make sense for the Wizard character to insist that he check as well? If some meta-knowledge is ok, and others are not, please discuss that with your players. Though it gets talked about like its some sort of sin, some meta-game knowledge is ok to have at your table as long as everyone is having fun.

- **MinMaxing**\
What is your stance on this as a DM? Do you welcome optimized characters, even if the character concept/theme is ridiculous? Perhaps you simply tolerate it, as long as it doesn't become an issue? Or perhaps you & your players decided to play a campaign that is more about ROLL-play than Role-play? Are veterans allowed to help newer players optimize their PCs? If optimized PCs are allowed or encouraged, you may want to let your players know that it is also fine to play unoptimized characters as well.

- **Character Party fit**\
That 'loner' character? Are they allowed? If so, at what limits? Is it ok if a PC just tags along ONLY to do combat & avoid anything social? D&D is a social based game, you may wish to encourage your players to create characters that play well with others and that will fit with the party. On the other hand, you may want to be mindful about players potentially bullying other players into playing races & classes they do not want to play. Party fit should not limit class & race choice.

- **Murder Hobos**\
What is your stance on this as a DM? Is it allowed? Is it allowed, but there will be in-game consequences? Maybe your playing an evil campaign, & this is exactly what you want in this campaign. DMs understand that D&D by its nature & history encourages this style of game-play, so be forgiving but mindful.

- **Other behavior rules**\
Perhaps this is where you tell your players to be respectful to one another, or be communicative, etc.

## The DM

- **DM Style**\
As a DM, what is your style? Are you a RAW or RAI type DM? Do you prefer to improvise or prepare? Do you like making rulings on the spot & looking them up later, or would you rather pause the game & look up the rules? Do you like home-brewing & having home-brew content, or do you prefer to minimize home-brew? Do you prefer story over mechnics? Do you want ROLL-play or roleplay? How do you prep for a game-session? Share with your players your preferences as a DM.

- **Player Absences**\
You may want to discuss with your players, how many players get to be absent for the session before the game is canceled that night? What is the min amount of people you will DM for in a session? What happens when too few players show up? Maybe the players that do show up get in some 'down-time' play that can provide minor benefits or perhaps progresses some down-time activities that had going on? Maybe you can do a one-shot you been planning for? What is your backup plan; play board-games, video-games? watch movies?

- **Player Narrative Authority**\
Do you allow your players to have some narrative authority in your game? How much say do you allow in your game/campaign, for each player? For example; Can the Cleric player create the deity she follows & you as a DM allow her to decide what her deity personality, attitudes, domain, & etc? Or does she have to select a deity from the book? Does the Goliath have a tribe/herd? Who is the leader of his Herd? Does the Paladin follow a specific sect or order? Maybe the Fighter is the son of a Farmer? So now there is a whole farm in your game that, when the party arrives at, the Fighter player now becomes an assistant DM. This can go a LONG way to allowing your players feel ATTACHED to the game setting.

- **Pet Peeves**\
This is where you can discuss your own personal pet-peeves. Things about the game that really bother you as a DM. It is ok to have them, even though you may would rather avoid them. Just remember that when discussing them, your coming from a place of kindness & doing so to inform them so to avoid issues later on.

## Experience
- **Earning XP**\
How do players earn EXP? Does the monster/creature have to be slain? or are your monsters obstacles that simply need be overcome? What if the players defeat a monster non-violently? Do you earn XP at all, or use the *milestones* variant (DMG p. 261)

- **Level-up**\
When do PCs level up? Long rest? Short rest? Once they are back in town? only between game sessions? or the moment they gain enough exp?
